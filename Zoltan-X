## Dream of Equality of Mankind  

**I have a dream**,  
that one day,  
**mankind will be equal**  
all over the World  
and that we **will unite**  
all together  
over **planet earth**.  
  
That we will  
**break down national borders**  
and treat planet earth  
as **god given**  
**Garden Eden of plurality**.  
  
That we will **accept our role**  
as **gods gardener**  
**on this planet**  
and maybe one day,  
in **universe too**.  
  
That we will find  
a **peaceful**  
global way  
of **understanding**,  
by the **truth**  
of cosmology and **prime principles**  
in the **Ethology of Genesis**.  
  
And that we will treat  
**all beings**  
with **equality and respect**,  
and that we will stop  
erasing the **god given**  
**plurality of Life**.
